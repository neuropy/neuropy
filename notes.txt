- one of hte biggest strengths of polytrode is that it can record from lots of neurons simultaneously, can sample a reasonable size of the population activity, so population activity is what I'm trying to focus on
- whats the neural code?
	- play stimnspikes
	- show population raster plot, each row is a cell, time on horizontal axis, cells are all spiking at various times
	- is this just a bunch of cells firing independently of each other, representing their little portion of visual space? or is there any meaning in the activity of the populatoin as a whole? and if so, how do you go about finding it? listening to it or just looking at it doesn't get you very far.
- even if we can predict single cell responses, whats gotta be important for visual perception, and for the brain in general, is responses of gourps of cells, dsitrbuted response, not just individual response

- how can we predict how this network will behave? have to take correlations of cells into account
- look at pairs of neurons, find how correlated their spiking activity is
- called a xcorr
- explain xcorrs, strong, but mostly weak, examples

- recent interesting paper in came out in Nature, Schneidmann
- in retina

- if assume cells behaving independently of one another, your pattern distribution doesn't match reality
- show patteerns as vertical bars of 10 cells, or as simply vertical 1s and 0s
- draw traingle: not just cell 1 or cell 2 are affecting respone, but their activity together is iimportant. Triplets, quads, etc. astronomical to analyze. simult firing for cell triplets/quads very low, so to get stat signif, need exteremely long recordsings, cite number of cell pairs, cell triplets, cell quads for group of 10 cells.

- check cells, error correction

- maybe pairwise isn't enuf for cortex?

- could help in solving the binding problem








- todo: for the time bins, try lots of different phases, and look if the common states
- todo: look at common states, and see if theres a gradual falloff of probs of being 1 bit, 2bit 3 bit off of that state as you move away from it in bitspace
