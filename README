Neuronal data analysis in Python

          object hierarchy:

                                level:

                Animal            1
                  |
                Track             2             Track
                  |                               |
              Recording           3           TrackSort
             /         \                          |
       Experiment      Sort       4          TrackNeuron
            |           |

As for variable scope, this is how things work:

Main Qt event loop creates a
    NeuropyWindow which runs an
        IPython session which imports
            neuropy modules
    
So, something like get_ipython() only works from within those neuropy modules
that have been imported during the IPython session, but not in any of
NeuropyWindow's methods.


Dependencies:

neuropy requires recent versions of the following to be installed:

Python (2.x, 3.x hasn't been tested)
IPython 0.14.dev
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
PyQt4 (PySide will probably work, but is untested)

To install for use as a library:

$ python setup.py install

To run:

$ python main.py # in the neuropy folder
