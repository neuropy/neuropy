neuropy is a Python package for interactive analysis of sorted neuronal spike
data and raw LFP waveforms.

          object hierarchy:

                                level:

                Animal            1
                  |
                Track             2             Track
                  |                               |
              Recording           3           TrackSort
             /         \                          |
       Experiment      Sort       4          TrackNeuron
            |           |
      (Cat15Movie)    Neuron      5

As for variable scope, this is how things work:

Main Qt event loop creates a
    NeuropyWindow which runs an
        IPython session which imports
            neuropy modules
    
So, something like get_ipython() only works from within those neuropy modules
that have been imported during the IPython session, but not in any of
NeuropyWindow's methods.

Dependencies:

neuropy requires recent versions of the following to be installed:

Python (2.7.x, 3.x hasn't been tested)
IPython 1.0.dev
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
PyQt4 (PySide will probably work, but is untested)
Cython

neuropy is developed in Ubuntu 12.10. It should work in other Linux
distributions. In principle, it should also work in Windows and OSX.

To run:

$ python main.py # in the neuropy folder

To install for use as a library:

$ python setup.py install
