    thread-local copies of the variable will be reduced with the operator and assigned to
    the original variable after the loop." After incrementing (and causing a reduction),
    Cython doesn't allow reading the variable later within the loop, raising this error:
    "Cannot read reduction variable in loop body". Assigning to it initially in a `with
    parallel()` block doesn't help - that only works for buffers (I think). There are two
    ways around this currently: 1) don't do in-place operations; 2) abstract the whole loop
    out into its own function, where the thread-local and reductions rules don't apply. For
    now, I've done the former. See:
